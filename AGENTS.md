# Working on nanobot

The Python gateway owns agent execution, sessions, tools, memory, and security policy. WebUI and TUI share that runtime; keep execution and policy out of the clients.

## Task-specific guidance

| When working on | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Core boundaries, extensions, or internal types | [`.agent/design.md`](.agent/design.md) |
| Refactoring, fallbacks, or test selection | [`.agent/simplify.md`](.agent/simplify.md) |
| Path permissions, HTTP/MCP, or shell isolation | [`.agent/security.md`](.agent/security.md) |
| Dependency setup, WebUI transport, config, Windows, prompts, or persistence | [`.agent/gotchas.md`](.agent/gotchas.md) |
| Reusing verification evidence | [`.agent/workflow.md`](.agent/workflow.md) |
| Contribution or publication | [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md) |

## Development constraints

- Analyze the required behavior, state ownership, and root cause before extending existing code. Refactor when the structure causes the problem; a smaller diff does not justify another fallback.
- Do not add defensive tests for hypothetical internal states or unsupported combinations. Each new test needs a reachable path and a meaningful contract to protect.
- Do not run `ruff format`; mechanical formatting obscures git blame and creates unrelated diffs. This constraint takes precedence over the optional touched-file formatting in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
