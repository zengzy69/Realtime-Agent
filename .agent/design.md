# Design Constraints

Consult this document when changing ownership boundaries, extension points, abstractions, or dynamic types. These constraints apply to implementation choices on those paths.

## Core stays small; extend at the edges

New capabilities should be added via `channels/`, `tools/`, skills, or MCP servers. The files `agent/loop.py` and `agent/runner.py` form the critical core path; changes there should be minimal and justified. If a feature can live in a channel adapter, a tool, or an external MCP server, it should not be inlined into the agent loop.

Runtime state fan-out follows the same boundary. `MessageBus.publish` awaits local subscribers for turn/run/model/goal state changes; `MessageBus.publish_event` queues routed channel delivery without waiting for network sends. Both carry `AgentEvent` values. Runner hooks publish typed output through the turn's scoped `EventSink`; direct-call callbacks are adapted at the execution boundary. WebUI/WebSocket wire details, title refreshes, and goal-state sync belong in `nanobot.session.webui_turns.WebuiTurnCoordinator` or the relevant channel adapter.

## Prefer duplication over premature abstraction

Channels and providers are allowed to repeat similar logic (send retries, media handling, message splitting). Do not introduce complex base classes or shared helpers just to eliminate duplication across channel files. Each channel file should remain self-contained and readable on its own. The same applies to provider implementations.

## Type dynamic boundaries at the edge

Wire payloads, persisted records, and third-party SDK objects are untrusted dynamic boundaries. Prefer a parser or small normalizer at the owning edge, and use `TypedDict` for stable dictionary shapes, so validation happens once and internal code receives a concrete type. Do not spread raw dynamic dictionaries or SDK objects through the core.

Stable first-party dependencies must be typed where they are stored or passed. Do not declare an internal service, context field, or callback result as `Any` and then recover its real type with consumer-side casts. Use the concrete type or a narrow `Protocol`; reserve `Any` for genuinely dynamic boundaries.

Every new cast must be supported by a boundary check or an invariant established by construction and control flow. Do not add redundant checks inside a validated path or use `cast` only to silence BasedPyright.

## Explicit over magical

Configuration belongs in `config/schema.py` Pydantic models. Provider auto-detection must remain traceable from the factory to the concrete provider class.
