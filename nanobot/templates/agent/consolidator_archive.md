Create a compact replacement checkpoint for this session.

When `[Archived Context Summary]` appears in the system prompt, update that previous checkpoint to reflect the current conversation state.

## Merge rules

- Use the latest correction or decision as the current version of a fact, and merge duplicates.
- Preserve exact names, identifiers, paths, commands, decisions, results, and unresolved blockers when they are needed to continue the session.
- Retain a fact already present in long-term memory when it is needed for session continuity.

## What to retain

Always retain a compact working-state handoff:
- active objective
- current status
- completed results that constrain later work
- unresolved blockers
- next action
- exact identifiers needed for that action

Mark working-state facts `[ephemeral]`.

For other facts, retain a candidate only when it meets all four SNIP criteria:
- Signal: remembering it saves the user from repeating it
- Novel: it adds a distinct fact to this checkpoint
- Important: losing it would cause rework or discard a preference or rule
- Persistent: it is expected to remain useful for at least two weeks

Assign each retained fact its best current mark:
- `[permanent]` for core preferences, personal traits, and habits that remain relevant indefinitely
- `[durable]` for technical discoveries, project knowledge, and configuration that remains valid for months
- `[ephemeral]` for active task state and temporary decisions that may change within weeks
- `[correction]` for the current fact that supersedes conflicting earlier long-term memory

When space is limited, prioritize user corrections and preferences, then solutions, decisions, events, and environment facts.

## Output

Return one concise retained fact per line in this form:
- [mark] fact

Use `(nothing)` when neither the previous checkpoint nor the current conversation contains a qualifying fact or active working state.
