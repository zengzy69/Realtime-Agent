# How to Configure Model Fallback in nanobot

Model fallback lets nanobot try a primary model first, then fall back to one or
more named presets when the primary provider fails or rate-limits.

## What you will build

- two or more `modelPresets`
- a primary `agents.defaults.modelPreset`
- an ordered `agents.defaults.fallbackModels` chain

## When to use this

Use fallback when you want better reliability across rate limits, provider
outages, local model downtime, or cost-sensitive routing.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install nanobot-ai
nanobot onboard --wizard
nanobot agent -m "Hello!"
```

Verify each provider works before adding it as a fallback.

## Minimal working example

Merge this shape into `~/.nanobot/config.json` and replace provider/model names
with ones you control:

```json
{
  "modelPresets": {
    "Fast": {
      "provider": "primary-provider",
      "model": "primary-model-id",
      "maxTokens": 4096,
      "contextWindowTokens": 65536,
      "temperature": 0.1
    },
    "Deep": {
      "provider": "fallback-provider",
      "model": "fallback-model-id",
      "maxTokens": 4096,
      "contextWindowTokens": 200000,
      "temperature": 0.1
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "modelPreset": "Fast",
      "fallbackModels": ["Deep"]
    }
  }
}
```

String entries in `fallbackModels` are preset names, not raw model IDs.
Replace the placeholder model IDs with currently supported model IDs from your
provider. The [Provider Cookbook](../provider-cookbook.md) has concrete recipes
for common providers.

## Production notes

- In the WebUI, a reply produced by a named fallback preset shows its provider
  logo and preset name next to the reply timestamp. Hover, focus, or click the
  badge for an explanation. The composer still shows your selected preset;
  primary replies have no fallback badge. Saved replies retain the name used
  for that invocation, even after a preset is renamed or deleted. Older replies
  without recorded attribution and unnamed inline fallback objects are not labeled.
- Keep fallback context windows realistic; smaller fallback windows constrain
  how much context can fit.
- Put cheaper or faster fallbacks before expensive ones when acceptable.
- Use `/model <preset>` for runtime switching without editing config.
- Keep preset names human-readable; the same name appears in the WebUI and `/model`.

## Security notes

- Different providers may have different data handling policies.
- Do not put provider keys directly in shared config files.
- Confirm fallback models can safely receive the same prompts and files.

## Troubleshooting

- If a fallback never triggers, confirm the primary error is treated as
  retryable/fallbackable.
- If startup fails, check that each fallback string matches a key under
  `modelPresets`.
- If output is truncated after fallback, review `maxTokens` and
  `contextWindowTokens`.
